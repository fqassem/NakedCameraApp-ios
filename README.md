# Naked Camera App

This is a pure iOS implementation of the Naked Camera App I created in React-Native. I've been having a lot of problems with the camera inside of RN. The build also takes FOREVER after ejecting Expo, so I decided to create a barebones iOS version of the app using Swift. Compiles and builds almost immediately and works without any headache.
